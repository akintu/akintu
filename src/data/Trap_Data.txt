# Trap_Data.txt
# 
# Contains data about "overworld" or rather, "hostile" traps that exist both in and
# out of combat.  
#
# Stats are given at a "per level" basis and a "base", where a trap rating of 2 + 3L
# and a level of 6 indicate that a level 6 trap of that type has a rating of 20.  
# If the result is a decimal, it should be rounded.
#

# This stat should be updated when any weight is added/subtracted but it is not code.
# Total Rarity weight in the pool: 39
