# help_status_effects_basics.txt

Status Effects are altered states of being for a character or monster.
These include beneficial statuses (sometimes called "buffs") as well as
detrimental statuses (sometimes called "debuffs").  Most statuses have a 
duration, of number of turns remaining, associated with them.  When the 
duration expires, the status effect is removed.

Status icons representing the status, and a number of turns until removal
are displayed on every character and monster's unit frames on the right
side of the screen.

Some statuses do not expire in a standard way.  These are usually statuses
like "Stealth" that have alternate ways to expire (such as via attacking.)
Such statuses will not have a duration displayed alongside it on the
screen.

Some statuses have elements that indicate which kind of potion should be
used to remove it.  For instance, a Cold elemental monster might apply a 
cold-based status effect on you.  In that case, you could use the
appropriate potion to relieve the status: a "thawing potion."

Some area-of-effect spells such as Smoke Screen and Zone of Silence apply
a buff or debuff to characters and monsters simply by walking through the
affected area they cover.
