# help_dodge_mechanics.txt

In Akintu, physical attacks all have a chance to be Dodged.  If the attack
is Dodged, it will be listed as a "miss".  (Avoidance is separate and is
not typically in play unless a player is in stealth.)

Successfully landing blows require good Accuracy.  Melee attacks rely on
Melee Accuracy.  Ranged attacks rely on Ranged Accuracy.  

Successfully dodging attacks require good Dodge.  Melee Dodge and Ranged
Dodge contribute to the chance to dodge for their respective incoming
attacks.  

The exact mechanics of physical hits are listed in the wiki.  Some details
are listed here as well.

If Accuracy is exactly equal to Dodge: Chance to hit = 80%
Maximum chance to hit = 100%
Minimum chance to hit = 5%
Chance to hit above 100% contribute a small amount of critical hit chance*.
Chance to hit below 5% detracts significantly from critical hit chance*.

*Note that monsters cannot perform physical critical hits ever.
