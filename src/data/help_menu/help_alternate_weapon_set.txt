# help_alternate_weapon_set

In Akintu, when you equip your weapon(s)/shield on your character they 
become red in the equipment screen. You gain all benefits associated with 
these weapons.

If you equip your weapon/armor via the alternate equipment keys (DEFAULT:
hold down ALT while equipping), you will equip them in an alternate weapon 
slot. This will make them blue in color and have no direct impact on your 
characteristics. However, when you are in combat, if you press the key to 
swap weapons (DEFAULT key: O) it will consume 5 AP and you will then be 
using your previously alternate weapons (your "red" and "blue" equipment 
will be swapped.)

This can be useful for switching between ranged and melee weapons according
to the position of your enemy as well as switching between a two-handed 
weapon to a weapon/shield combo as you need to rely more on defense in some
situations.

Unequipping alternate weapons is performed identically to unequipping 
primary weapons.
