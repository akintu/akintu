In Akintu, most poison effects have a chance to be "tolerated", or in other
words, ignored.  This is dependent on the victim's Poison Tolerance 
attribute which is primarily increased via Constitution.  Most poison
damage as well as (harmful) poison status effects can be tolerated.

The attacker's poison has a specific Poison Rating which is dependent on
the ability in use and any Poison Rating bonuses specified.  

The exact mechanics for this computation is listed in the wiki, but it 
suffices to say that if the Poison Tolerance and Poison Rating are equal,
there is a 50% chance that a poison will be tolerated.  If the defender's
Poison Tolerance is at least double the Poison Rating, it will always be 
tolerated.

Note that Poison Resistance and Poison Tolerance are independent and
unrelated.  Poison Resistance is used to mitigate the amount of damage from
"successful" poison sources, and does not factor into the above computation
at all.
