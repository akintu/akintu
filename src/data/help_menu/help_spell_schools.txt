# help_spell_schools.txt

Spells in Akintu are categorized by which "school" of magic they belong to.
Certain Wizard traits grant bonuses to spells from particular schools.
Three of the schools are only available to specific classes; the remaining
four are available to all casters.

Common Spell Schools

  Illusion
    Spells are tactical in nature, often affecting specific tiles on the
    pane rather than monsters or players.
  
  Mystical
    Spells are either self-buffs that cannot be cast on anyone but yourself
	or deal Arcane damage to enemies (an element that few enemies have
	innate resistances to.)
	
  Natural
    Spells include defensive buffs, healing spells, and poison or holy 
	damage spells.
	
  Primal
    Spells typically focus on dealing fire, cold, or electrical damage.
	
Restricted Spell Schools

  Bane (Nightblade only)
    Spells involve dealing Shadow damage or debuffs but frequently have
	a few short range.
	
  Enchantment (Spellsword only)
    Spells involve offensive buffs to yourself or allies as well as a few
	debuffing spells used against enemies.
	
  Mental (Tactician only)*
    Spells are primarily useful against enemy casters but this school also
	contains some "crowd-control" spells used to keep weaker enemies
	from overwhelming you while you deal with larger threats.
	
*Both the Tactician and Mental spell school are coming soon.
