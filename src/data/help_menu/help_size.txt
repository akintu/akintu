# help_size.txt

Size is an attribute that only monsters have.  It is represented by a small
character to the left of their level, displayed on their unit frames.  For
example, the text: "S L3" indicates that the monster is small and is level 
3.  

Size plays a role in specific abiliites.  Usually, larger monsters are
resistant to abiliites that are sensitive to size.  However, there are a 
few exceptions (such as the spell "Shrink") that work less effectively 
against smaller monsters.  

The possible sizes are:

SMALL  -- S
MEDIUM -- M
LARGE  -- L
HUGE   -- H
