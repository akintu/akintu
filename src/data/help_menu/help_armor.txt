Armor in Akintu is broken up into pieces according to which part of the
body they protect.  All armor has an amount of physical damage mitigated
via Damage Reduction (DR).  Additionally, all armor has a type which 
determines which classes can wear it without penalty (see Armor Tolerance
for more details) and, like all items, a weight.  Armor also has an 
innate modifier for your Dodge and Sneak ratings, with heavier armor
penalizing them and lighter armor granting bonuses to them.

Example:

  Platemail Breastplate
    -- Name of item; no prefix or suffix indicates it is non-magical. --
  
  Grade: Heavy
    -- Determines Armor Tolerance penalities, if any --
  Type: Chest
    -- Part of body covered by armor --
  Damage Reduction(DR): 17%
    -- Amount of physical damage ignored while wearing this armor --
  Dodge Modifier: 0
    -- Bonus/Penalty to Dodge; this armor does not impact Dodge. --
  Stealth Modifier: -30
    -- Bonus/Penalty to Sneak; this armor virtually prohibits Stealth. --
  Weight: 25 lbs.
    -- How heavy this is in your inventory, contributes to Burden. --
  Value: 225 gold
    -- How much this is worth before any discount or markup --
