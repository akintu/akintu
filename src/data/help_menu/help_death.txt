# help_death.txt

Death in Akintu is permanent if your created your character as "hardcore".
All saved games using that character are deleted and you are forced to
begin with a new character with none of your old gear or experience.

If you are not playing a hardcore character, you are playing Akintu in
"softcore" (the default) mode.  When you die, you will lose 10% of your
gold and will be teleported to the home pane in the center of the world.
