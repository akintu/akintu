Detecting Traps

The attributes Awareness and Intuition are both used to detect hidden
traps. Whichever of those two attributes is higher will be used to detect 
hidden traps -- they do not add together.  Every hidden trap in combat will
be silently checked to see if any players can see it.  The better your
Awarness/Intuition you have, the greater the chance of detection.  

As soon as one player can see a trap, he will automatically mark that trap
for all other players to see.  Traps can still be triggered by stepping on
them, however.  Traps that are visible are capable of being disarmed by 
adjacent players with the Disarm Trap skill.

When a trap is more than 4 tiles away from a player, she will have a lower
chance of detecting it than usual.  The chance decreases the further away
the player is from the hidden trap.  Players cannot detect traps more than
10 tiles away.


Stealth

When you enter stealth, your Sneak attributed is compared against the
Awareness attribute of every monster in combat with you.  Every turn, each
monster will try to detect you.  If it succeeds, it will treat you as any
other non-stealthed player for that turn.  Each turn, every monster has to
make that check to detect you.  Monsters with high Cunning have high
Awareness.
