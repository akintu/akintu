# help_treasure_chests.txt

Treasure Chests contain gold, equipment, items and sometimes nothing at
all.  Higher level areas will have treasure chests with more valuable
contents.  

To open a treasure chest, press the G (GET) key while adjacent
to it.  If the treasure chest is not locked, that will open the treasure
chest for you and give treasure to every player currently on the pane.
Every player is given his own "loot" independent of every other player.
Thus, it is polite to wait for your friends to join you on your pane
before opening up a chest.

Sometimes chests are locked.  If you are a class with Lockpicking, you
can attempt to unlock the chest with the same key you would use to open
it normally, G (GET).  If your Cunning is high enough, you will be able
to unlock it without damaging the contents.

If you cannot unlock the chest, you may attempt to BASH the lock with B.
Bashing a lock will always damage the contents, lowering the magical
properties present on the items when you get them.  Bashing is not always
successful on the first try.  Every attempt damages the contents further.
If your Strength is high, you will be more likely to break the lock on
your first try, limiting the damage to the contents.  

Chests found in higher level areas will have locks that are more difficult
to unlock or bash open.  In these situations it is wise to wait for your
friends with higher Cunning (or at least Strength) to help you open these
stubborn locks before you ruin the gear.
