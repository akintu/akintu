# help_spellpower_and_magic_resist.txt

In Akintu, all hostile spells must overcome a character's magic resist in
order to take effect.  The higher the magic resist is compared to the
caster's spellpower, the greater the chance that the spell will be ignored.

The result of casting such a hostile spell can be broken down into four
categories:

Normal Hit
  Spell has normal effect; Magic Resist and Spellpower are rougly equal.
  
Critical Hit
  Some spells gain a benefit from critical hits, enhancing their effects.
  Magic resist is very low compared to the Spellpower.  Critical hits are
  often no different than "Normal Hits"; it depends on the individual spell
  cast whether or not an additional bonus is granted.
  
Partial Resist
  Some spells are diminished by partial resists, but most spells have the
  same effect as a Normal Hit in this circumstance.  Again, it depends on
  the individual spell being cast.  This indicated that the Magic resist
  is probably a little higher than the Spellpower.
  
Full Resist
  All spells have no effect when fully resisted.  The magic resist must be
  massively higher than the spellpower for this to happen.
  
Overall, spells are more reliable than physical attacks because only in the
case of full resists are most spells affected by the defenses of the
victim.  Keep in mind that elemental resistances will usually play a role
in the end result of the spell as well; they are analogous to DR for 
physical attacks.
