# help_armor_tolerance.txt

Armor tolerance (AT) determins how heavy (in terms of armor grade not
weight) of armor you can equip without having suffering any penalty.
If you equip armor beyond your tolerance, your maximum AP will be 
decreased.  This effect stacks with any decreased AP from equipment
burden (carrying around more stuff than you can carry.)

Every piece of armor has an Armor Grade (AG).  When you AG is greater 
than your AT, you lose AP.  See the wiki for details on this mechanic.
