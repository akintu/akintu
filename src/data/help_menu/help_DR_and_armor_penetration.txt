# help_DR_and_armor_penetration.txt

In Akintu, most armor grants Damage Reduction (DR) which reduces the damage
received by physical attacks by a certain percent.  For example, a DR of 35 
reduces incoming physical damage by 35%.  

Attackers sometimes have weapons or abilities that ignore a set amount of
DR.  The property of being able to ignore some DR is called "Armor 
Penetration."  An Armor Penetration of 10 against a DR of 35 leaves 25% of
the incoming attack to be reduced.  

Armor Penetration will treat DR as
being below 0% if it is greater than the DR, however, a negative value of 
DR acts as 0%.  It will never augment the damage dealt.  

Similarly, a DR value greater than 80% is always treated as 80% reduction.    
If DR is above 80%, the excess DR will serve to reduce the effect that
Armor Penetration will have against the defender.  For example, a DR of
95% against Armor Penetration of 20 will reduce damage by 75% (not by 60%).

Successful physical attacks typically deal their damage as a physical
element.  Those elements are "Piercing", "Bludgeoning", and "Slashing".  
A few monsters have some resistances specific to one or more of those
elements; players do not ever have physical-elemental resistances.  

Physical elemental resistances "stack" with DR multiplicatively.  

Such resistances are uncomon, but amongst them, Slashing resistance is the
most common, then Piercing, and then Bludgeoning.  This makes bludgeoning
weapons a little more desireable in a few circumstances.
