Akintu has 7 magical elements and 3 physical elements.  These elements are 
used to deal damage and sometimes apply status effects.  Monsters and
players can acquire resistances to elemental damage and gain bonuses to the
elemental damage they deal of particular types.  

In general, if a monster is strong against a particular element, it will be
weak to its opposite element.  This is not always true, but it is a general
tendency.  Also, monsters that deal damage of a particular element will 
frequently be strong against that element.  See the controls page for the
button to use to ANALYZE your current target to see their elemental and
physical strengths and weaknesses.  

The elements (listed in pairs of opposites) are:

  Fire and Cold
  Poison* and Electric
  Divine and Shadow
  Arcane**
  
The physical elements are:

  Bludgeoning
  Piercing
  Slashing
  
Only monsters can possess elemental resistances to the physical elements.  
However, such resistances are rare and usually not very strong.

Elemental Resistance to Fire of 40% reduces damage by that amount.
Elemental Power of Fire (players only) of 40% will increase outgoing fire
damage by 40%.  These influences are multiplicative, not additive like
DR and Armor Penetration.  Example:

  Player's fire spell deals 100 damage normally.  
  + 40% Fire Power bonus = 140 damage.
  Monster's Fire resistance is 40% so:
  - 40% Damage = 140 - 56 = 84 damage
  
Reistances above 80% are treated as 80% but will serve as a buffer against
statuses that lower elemental resistance.

*Poison Elemental Resistance is separate from Poison Tolerance.

**Arcane has no opposite; monsters rarely have a resistance to Arcane
  damage.
