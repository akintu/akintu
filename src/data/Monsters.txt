# Monsters.txt
#
# File will first be used as a drawing board for monster types and some rules.
#

# Considerations for Monsters:
#
# Monsters do not have Constitution -- their "HP" is their absolute total HP.
# Monsters do not have Might or Force (although they do have Strength).
# Monsters cannot deal physical critical hits (but their spells can crit if it is a critcal-spell.)
# Monsters do not have Piety (but they may have MP and they do have magic resist).
# Monsters do not have Sorcery (but they do have Spellpower).
