# Monsters.txt
#
# File will first be used as a drawing board for monster types and some rules.
#

# Considerations for Monsters:
#
# Monsters do not have Constitution -- their "HP" is their absolute total HP.
# Monsters do not have Might or Force (although they do have Strength).
# Monsters cannot deal physical critical hits (but their spells can crit if it is a critcal-spell.)
# Monsters do not have Piety (but they may have MP and they do have magic resist).
# Monsters do not have Sorcery (but they do have Spellpower).

# ..Grouping Points..
#
# GP determines how much of a monster party is filled up by the presence of this monster.
# A party can be formed of a small number of high GP monsters or a large number of small GP monsters.
# With more players, the total GP of the groups will rise.
#
# Also the HP of the monsters will be multiplied when a group is present:
#
# 1 Player:  10 GP & 100% HP
# 2 Players: 13 GP & 150% HP
# 3 Players: 16 GP & 200% HP
# 4 Players: 20 GP & 250% HP

# Special Attack 1
# Special Attack 2
# Special Attack 3
# Special Property
