Team Name:  Gelatinous Cube
Project Name:  Akintu

Akintu is a multi-player role-playing game which is modeled after the genre of
Roguelikes, based on the 1980s game Rogue.  The player can choose from a
variety of races and classes, and then adventure through a randomly-generated
world, fighting monsters and collecting treasure.  We have over 50 different
race/class combinations, many different monsters, and millions of possible
randomly-generated items in the game.  Up to 4 players can play together.  The
game is written exclusively in Python, leveraging the Pygame libraries and
Twisted network engine.
